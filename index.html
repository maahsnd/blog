    <p class="entry-title">First time in Canada</p>
    <p class="date">10.22.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">I went to Canada for the first time today. We crossed the border North of Buffalo to see the Niagara Falls from the Canadian side. The falls didn't disappoint, but they weren't quite the most memorable part. That would be a man posing for a photo in front of the falls, clutching his pet chicken (a small, black variety) to his cheek. His wife took the photo without a complaint. Later on, I saw their child--a boy of no more than 3 or 4--struggling to hold the chicken to his chest. It squirmed loose, and he started to cry.</li>

    <p class="entry-title">Why I write</p>
    <p class="date">10.23.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">Often, when I’m not writing I feel a strong sense   of guilt. I miss writing when I think about it, when I see great writing. But the first reaction that surges to me is guilt, shame too perhaps. The sense that I am not what I should be, not doing what I should do. That’s not the right emotion to write from, not the right source to draw motivation from. If I am to write, it must be for myself, for my joy or, if not joy, some other emotional expression.            </li>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="entry-title">I've just seen a face</p>
    <p class="date">10.24.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">I got home from work today, running on fumes after 2 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work. Carrying my grocery bag up the steps, I heard a few strands of "I've Just Seen a Face" float faintly in on the breeze. Not a song I expected to hear, not there, amidst all the SU students.</li>

  <div class="entry">
    <p class="entry-title">Starting piano</p>
    <p class="date">10.25.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">I started piano lessons at the Westcott co-op today. It lacked the glamor I imagined, but not in a bad way. It made me feel like a child, but not in a bad way. I haven't felt like such an absolute beginner in a while, but sitting there, struggling through a one-handed, rudimentary "Ode to Joy," I sure felt it.</li>

    <p class="entry-title">Smell of bread rising</p>
    <p class="date">10.26.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">Walking out of pilates after work today, I saw a beauty in downtown Syracuse that I rarely recognize. A soft rain had just lapsed, the sun had just finished setting, leaving the sky a dim, deep blue; the temperature floated around the mid 60's.</li>
    <li class="entry-text"> At home, I tidied up my apartment, made a simple dinner. I sat down to watch some basketball, felt a moment of elation watching Bones Hyland sling a behind the back pass to Jeff Green to end a fast break with a dunk. Shortly after, I lifted a plate off a large metal bowl to check the status of my rising bread. The smell of yeast, of fresh dough filled the room like a smiling sigh.</li>
