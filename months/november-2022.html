    <p class="date">11.1.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">I made a jar's worth tonight. I took my time slicing the onion thinly, then the garlic. I brought a mixture of brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, white vinegar, salt, oregano and bay leaves to a simmer, then poured it over the onions and garlic, stuffed into a large, re-used mason jar. I've missed simple kitchen tasks like this; they used to be a much larger part of my life, before things began to feel so busy.</li>

    <p class="entry-title">Talking to a stranger in the Fitz</p>
    <p class="date">11.4.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">I went out with Austin and Asriel on Friday night. First to York, then to Bar, then the Fitz before stopping at Nick's Tomato Pie and heading home. At the Fitz, we sat next to a middle-aged woman (who I initially guessed to be early 30's before Austin and Asriel clowned me, pointing out that she was plainly in her early 50's). She said she was from Flagstaff. It got me thinking about the Western U.S. in a very wistful manner. I've missed Denver since I was 18, I realized, as I thought abstractly about what the West was like before my time, before white people settled there.</li>

    <p class="entry-title">Watching kites fly on a warm fall day</p>
    <p class="date">11.5.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">I went on a neighborhood walk by myself in an effort to slow down, be mindful, regulate my mood a bit. I walked in the direction my curiosity urged me. Meandering in the neighborhood bordering Barry park, I saw young families out at play, waved at a smiling, shy baby, and appreciated houses and gardens I'd never seen before. I absent-mindedly thought about gardening until for a while until I decided it was time to turn around. I walked by the park on the way back, and stood leaning against the fence for a while, watching some people fly their kites in the warm fall winds.</li>

    <p class="entry-title">Sun shine on a cold afternoon</p>
    <p class="date">11.8.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">I've started meditating again, on the advice of my therapist. Around 1, I walked outside of the HR office, and went to sit beneath a tree on the hill sloping down from the old tennis courts. The air was bracingly cold, a sharp contrast from this weekend's warmth, but the sun shone warmly on my face. As I sat there, meditating, I felt that warmth, opened my eyes to look out on Syracuse, and thought with all sincerity, this is a glorious thing.

    <p class="entry-title">Ithaca Sunday/p>
    <p class="date">11.13.2022</p>
    <li class="entry-text">The weather was fiercely discouraging, but Ray and I decided to brave it and head to Ithaca for the afternoon anyways. As we drove, we encountered pockets of clear skies, even sun. The rain, sleet, slight snow returned miles later, only to vanish again. By the time we reached Ithaca, we arrived to a fine fall day. We walked around Cornell campus, circling the Beebe lake and reading an informational graphic next to a dam about Cornell's founder. The weather soon caught up with us, as the same rain/sleet/snow mixture resumed its fall. We walked to the bookstore, passing by an art shop's window display featuring a variety of quaint miniature dioramas.

  <p class="entry-title">Youssou N'Dour & The Westcott Co-Op</p>
  <p class="date">11.14.2022</p>
  <li class="entry-text">Stopped by the Westcott Co-Op after work to go grocery shopping. Having a grocery store in the neighborhood, especially one with such nice products, is one of the highlights of my life here.
  </li>
  <li class="entry-text"> I took my groceries home, put on a record--Youssou N'Dour's "Nelson Mandela"--and made dinner. A nice night. </li>
